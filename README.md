# Dataframes Benchmark

This is for easily benchmarking Pandas dataframes and its accelerated alternatives.

## Targets

Currently dataframes from libraries below are included in benchmark.

- Pandas
- FireDucks
- Dask
- Modin (Ray / Dask)
- Polars

## Todo

It's just for my own use currently, it's dirty simple and easy.
(but maybe I will make it a real benchmark tool later if I can still keep interested in this.)

- Add PySpark.
- Add more test case.
- Add matplotlib scripts for benchmark charts.
...

Note that I mark it as WTFPL license, so feel free do whatever you want with these scripts.

## By the way

If you feel difficulty about which one should be chosen for your daily use,
personally I recommend FireDucks which is the most light-weight, best compatibility and the fastest of all, although it's not open source yet.
